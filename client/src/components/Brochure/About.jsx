      <p>
        DriveTime was founded by Rob VanArsdall and a group of four software
        developers - Ashok Sharma Jr., Travis Marrocco, Eric Engel, and Mohammed
        Marks.

        The intended purpose of this application is to allow student permit
        drivers to log and track their driving, in the measurement of hours, so
        that they can meet their requirements to eventually earn their license.
        At the moment, DriveTime is free and welcome to anyone.
